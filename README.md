# Denoising Autoencoder

## Description
### Autoencoder
* An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner. 
* The aim of an autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for dimensionality reduction, by training the network to ignore signal “noise”.
* It has one encoding and a decoding function.
